# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Deployment

This repository includes a `railway.toml` configuration so the app can be deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app). The file sets the project root to this directory and uses `npm start` (which runs `vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`) as the start command.

To deploy:
1. Install the Railway CLI and log in.
2. Run `railway up` to deploy using the configuration in `railway.toml`.
